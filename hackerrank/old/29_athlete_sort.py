# Task:
# You are given a spreadsheet that contains a list of N athletes and their details (such as age, height, weight and so on).
# You are required to sort the data based on the Kth attribute and print the final resulting table.
#
# Note that K is indexed from 0 to M-1, where M is the number of attributes.
# Note: If two attributes are the same for different rows, for example, if two atheletes are of the same age, print the row that appeared first in the input.
#
# Input Format
# The first line contains N and M separated by a space.
# The next N lines each contain M elements.
# The last line contains K.
#
# Output Format
# Print the  lines of the sorted table. Each line should contain the space separated elements.
